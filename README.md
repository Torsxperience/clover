## Getting started

1. Install with yarn

```
yarn add clover
```

or with npm

```
npm install clover
```
  
## TL;DR
First off, i'd like to point out that clover is **NOT**, I repeat **NOT** a generic site parser, it was built with my Univerisity's internet portal applictaion in mind. That being said, if you'd like to use parts of the code to perhaps build your own, you're more than welcome to do so. This package will be especially useful to CS majors at AUI, it provides casses for parsing and identification of static ```html``` content received from the server as well as some nicer higher level abstractions like ```APIs``` for making ```POST``` and ```GET``` calls to the applications server. All these are exposed via a very clean and simple ```API```. It is worthy of not however, that the this library uses raw string pattern matching to identify pages and this easily gets broken when the HTML server-side changes. I will try to keep this package as updated as possible, but chances are some things will change server-side (probably when i am no longer in the University). If this is the case, simply send a PR of tests for new ```matcher```, or update an existing on. That wasn't so long, now was it? üòä
